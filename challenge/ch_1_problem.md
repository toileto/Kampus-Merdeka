## Challenge 1 - Longest Increasing Subsequence

Write a Python function `longest_increasing_subsequence(arr)` that takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) within the list. An increasing subsequence is a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) in which the elements are in strictly increasing order.

*Instructions:*

1. Implement the longest_increasing_subsequence function to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
2. You should not modify the input list arr.
3. Your solution should have a time complexity better than O(n^2).

*Example:*

```python
sequence = [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60, 80]
result = longest_increasing_subsequence(sequence)
print(result)  # Output should be 6 (the longest increasing subsequence is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60, 80])
```
